# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this app is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## How I did it
I built a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
